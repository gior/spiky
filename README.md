Spiky
=====
Minimal Webpack 4 + Babel 7 setup. 

What is it for?
---------------
Spiky is a barebone setup to get you up and running with ES2015+ for your coding spikes.
Do you need to get a quick glance at a new library? Do you like to use modern js AND ensure legacy browser support? 
Are you tired of copying and pasting from random tutorials just to be able to import from a module? I certainly was.


Setup
-----
Clone this repo
```
  git clone git@github.com:gior/spiky.git
```
Install all dev dependencies      
```
  npm install
```
Build scripts in the src folder  
```
  npm run build
```
Open `index.html` see your gloriuous ES2015+ boilerplate in action.

Happy coding!
